# Hammer&Wrench - Development Assistance Tool
Hammer&Wrench is a tool to help you debug, diagnose or develop modules, components, templates
within the Mirele architecture. Simply install the tool in the template folder
and choose one of the paths:
1. Connect the file directly to the template
2. Use it as a CLI utility

### How do I install the tool in my Mirele distribution?
> __ATTENTION__: If you have already installed and worked with the Mirele developer tools - __CREATE BACKUP package.json FILE__! During the following operations this file will be overwritten.
If you do not have this file - you can ignore this warning.

The distribution is the same as the theme. By 'distribution' we mean the theme installed in your WordPress. 
The tool is very easy to install. You can do it with just one command

```console

The "install" step has been successfully completed")
```
